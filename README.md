## Survey Form

#### Link: [https://Suman373.github.io/Survey-Form/Survey%20Form]

### Purpose :
This is a survey form for an **online healthy meal service website** , which is a **practice project** of mine. I created this survey form to get the feedback of the meal services which it intends to *provide* to its customers.

### Browser support :
**Recommended** browser: Google Chrome Version 99.0.4844.84 (Official Build) (64-bit)
There shouldn't be any problem on *Microsoft Edge* , *Opera* , *Safari* and *Mozilla Firefox* 

### How to use :
User inputs such as Name , Email are necessary. Age is optional. Rest are according to the users. Feedback input field is also included to further improve and correct the issues our customers face.


### Acknowledgement : 
Online platforms such as **freeCodeCamp** , **Stackoverflow** and **CSS tricks** has really helped me improve both my understanding and skill in front-end development.

**Important** : This form doesn't have any backend currently, so clicking the submit button would only reset the fields in the form.
